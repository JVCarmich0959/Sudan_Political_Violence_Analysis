# Multi-Modal Approach to Conflict Analysis

A neuroscience-inspired AI framework for analyzing and predicting political violence using open conflict data.

## Overview

This project implements a Multi-Agent Tribal Intelligence (MATI) framework that mimics how different hemispheres and regions of the brain communicate to make complex decisions. Instead of using a single monolithic model, MATI employs specialized AI agents that analyze different dimensions of conflict data, communicate with each other, debate findings, and reach consensus - much like how our brains process multidimensional problems.

The framework addresses a fundamental insight: **conflict is multi-dimensional, so our approach to understanding it should be multi-dimensional too.** It's one of those beautiful situations where the solution mirrors the problem.

## The Problem

Traditional conflict analysis approaches often try to cram temporal patterns, geographic factors, social dynamics, and economic pressures into a single model. But real conflicts don't work that way - they emerge from complex interactions across multiple dimensions that require specialized analysis.

## The Solution: Tribal Intelligence

### Core Agents

- **Temporal Shaman** üï∞Ô∏è: Specializes in time series analysis, seasonal patterns, escalation timing, and historical precedent matching
- **Geographic Scout** üó∫Ô∏è: Focuses on spatial risk assessment, spillover effects, regional clustering, and border dynamics  
- **Severity Oracle** ‚ö°: Analyzes event magnitude, extreme violence detection, and escalation thresholds
- **Social Anthropologist** üë•: Examines actor behavior, targeting patterns, and strategic shifts *(planned)*
- **Economic Tracker** üí∞: Monitors resource-driven conflicts and economic pressures *(planned)*

### How It Works

1. **Individual Analysis**: Each agent analyzes the data from their specialized perspective
2. **Tribal Communication**: Agents share insights, challenge each other's findings, and debate interpretations
3. **Consensus Formation**: The "tribal council" synthesizes individual assessments into collective intelligence
4. **Continuous Learning**: Agent interactions and prediction outcomes improve future decision-making

## Current Implementation

### Data Source
- Primary dataset from [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/5efad450-8b15-4867-b7b3-8a25b455eed8)
- ACLED Sudan conflict events (2020-2025)
- Covers political violence, civilian targeting, and demonstrations

### Analysis Framework
- **Temporal Analysis**: Rolling averages, critical juncture identification (April 2023 escalation)
- **Geographic Analysis**: Hotspot identification, intervention prioritization scoring
- **Severity Assessment**: Event magnitude categorization, extreme violence patterns
- **Early Warning System**: Multi-indicator risk thresholds

## Key Findings (Sudan Case Study)

- Violence increased **5.1x** after April 2023 escalation
- Top 3 states account for **68.4%** of total fatalities  
- **15.7%** of fatalities come from just 23 extreme events (101+ deaths)
- Geographic concentration creates high spillover risk to neighboring regions

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/multi-agent-tribal-intelligence
cd multi-agent-tribal-intelligence
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```python
# Initialize tribal agents
temporal_shaman = TemporalShaman()
geographic_scout = GeographicScout()
severity_oracle = SeverityOracle()

# Create tribal council
tribal_council = TribalCouncil([temporal_shaman, geographic_scout, severity_oracle])

# Analyze your conflict data
session = tribal_council.convene_council(your_conflict_data)

# Get consensus predictions and recommendations
consensus = session['tribal_consensus']
print(f"Risk Level: {consensus['risk_level']}")
print(f"Confidence: {consensus['confidence']}")
```



## Contributing

This is an open-source project because **multi-dimensional problems need multi-dimensional solutions from many different sources!**

*This project is developed by an independent researcher passionate about using data science to understand and prevent conflict. It's created entirely in personal time with the hope that open collaboration can build something much more powerful than any individual effort.*

**Remember**: Every data point represents real human experiences. This work is ultimately about protecting people and preventing suffering.
